# ProgrammingAssignment_2
## Description:
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit
## to "caching the inverse of a matrix" rather than compute it repeatedly.

## In the present work, two functions are used to create a special object that 
## stores a matrix and caches its inverse.

## makeCacheMatrix
## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
